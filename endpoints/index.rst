Legacy Endpoints
================

These endpoints are part of our Starter, Basic, Core, and Plus plans and will remain 
entact and usable for users on these plans. As a user of these APIs you will still
get new providers, support, and any core extraction algorithm updates. 
There will however, be no additions to the response attributes or major version
updates to the endpoint. If you are interested in checking out some of the latest
and greatest APIs, read about :doc:`../products`.

All endpoints accept a similar set of :doc:`query arguments </arguments>`
and return similar :doc:`response objects </response>`.

Preview
-------
The preview endpoint was built to allow users to customize embeds. If you are
building something similar to the Facebook status message update functionality,
then this endpoint is for you. It returns multiple images, objects, and embeds
to choose from when creating an embed.

Objectify
---------
The objectify endpoint is the kitchen sink. This endpoint will pass back
everything we know about a URL in one shot. It is not as well structured as the
previous endpoints and it is only available to supplement those with desires
that we could not imagine. Enjoy!
